## Projects

### Eggventure Hunt
Virtual Easter Egg Hunt project for family. Nginx web server running on VPS by Digital Ocean, Amazon Route 53 for DNS, Github webhooks configured to assists with pull requests. Built with PHP and JS. Project is still under development but can be found [here](https://eggventurehunt.com).

### Poker AI
Creates a poker game between three LLMs: GPT 4o, Claude Opus, and Claude Sonnet. Models are prompted with defined personalities and will make decisions based on personality traits. Models have an opportunity to communicate in the chat and can communicate outside of their turn.

### REMI BOT
REMI BOT is an experimental project utilizing **Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus** model to visualize and manipulate data. After a CSV file is provided, the data is inserted into a **MySQL DB** and can be manipulated using **SQL** queries generated from natural language prompts. Visualization code can also be generated, utilizing the **Vega-Altair** python library. Finally, users can prompt Claude with research related questions, leveraging Claude's incredible problem solving capabilities. Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/AnthonyBliss1/REMI_BOT).

### MMA Machine Learning Model and Web Application
Created multiple web scraping scripts in **Python** to collect data from UFCStats.com and store in MySQL database. Cleaned data and created additional features with **SQL** to train a SNN model in predicting the outcome of UFC fights. Utilized GPT Assistant and Code Interpreter through the **OpenAI API** to generate a written analysis of the predicted fight using feature data and the predicted outcome from the trained model. Wrapped the model within a **Flask** application and deployed to Heroku where it could be accessed. Created a front-end JS application using **React** to allow users to send requests to the Flask back-end and was then stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Integrated an AWS Cloudfront distribution tied to a domain and hosted zone through Amazon Route 53.
